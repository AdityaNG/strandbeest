## Technical Documentation

### Overview
This document describes the implementation of a genetic algorithm (GA) designed to optimize the leg mechanism of Theo Jansen's Strandbeest. The algorithm aims to find optimal proportions for the 11-bar linkage system that creates the characteristic walking motion of these kinetic sculptures.

### Problem Definition
The Strandbeest leg mechanism consists of 11 connected bars that form a walking linkage. The optimization challenge is to determine the optimal lengths of these bars to achieve:
1. A nearly horizontal motion during the ground contact phase
2. Appropriate foot clearance during the return phase
3. Mechanical feasibility and stability

### Algorithm Implementation

#### Chromosome Structure
Each solution is represented as a list of 11 floating-point numbers corresponding to the lengths of the bars in the mechanism. The chromosome structure is:
```python
lengths = [crank_length, bar_2_length, ..., bar_11_length]
```

#### Fitness Function
The fitness function evaluates three key aspects:

1. Ground Flatness (50% weight)
   - Measures deviation from horizontal during ground contact phase
   - Lower deviation scores higher
   - Critical for smooth walking motion

2. Step Height (30% weight)
   - Evaluates foot clearance during return phase
   - Penalizes both insufficient and excessive height
   - Optimal range: 15-25% of mechanism height

3. Mechanical Complexity (20% weight)
   - Penalizes impractical bar length ratios
   - Considers manufacturing feasibility
   - Promotes robust mechanical design

#### Genetic Operators

##### Selection
- Tournament selection with size 5
- Provides good balance between exploration and exploitation
- Maintains genetic diversity while favoring better solutions

##### Crossover
- Single-point crossover
- Crossover point randomly selected
- Preserves successful sub-structures of solutions

##### Mutation
- Gaussian mutation with 10% mutation rate
- Maximum mutation magnitude: Â±10% of current value
- Helps escape local optima and maintains diversity

#### Evolution Strategy
- Population size: 100 individuals
- Elitism: Top 10% preserved
- Termination: 1000 generations or convergence
- Convergence defined as < 1% improvement over 50 generations

### Performance Metrics

The algorithm tracks several metrics during optimization:
1. Best fitness per generation
2. Population diversity
3. Convergence rate
4. Constraint violations

### Validation
Solutions are validated through:
1. Kinematic simulation
2. Physical feasibility checks
3. Stability analysis

### Implementation Notes

#### Critical Considerations
1. All length measurements are in millimeters
2. Minimum bar length: 10mm
3. Maximum bar length: 100mm
4. Angular resolution: 50 points per cycle

#### Optimization Parameters
- Population size: 100
- Generations: 1000
- Mutation rate: 0.1
- Tournament size: 5
- Elite count: 10

### Results Analysis

The optimization typically produces results with:
1. Ground contact deviation < 5mm
2. Step height between 15-25% of mechanism height
3. All bar lengths within manufacturable ranges

### Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:
1. Multi-objective optimization
2. Dynamic mutation rates
3. Advanced crossover methods
4. Real-time visualization
5. Parallel evaluation
